# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Team Roles

Understanding the various roles within a software development team is crucial for effective collaboration and project success. Based on industry standards and insights from the ITRexGroup blog, the following roles are integral to this project:

- **Product Owner (PO):**  
  Responsible for defining the product vision and ensuring it aligns with customer needs. Manages the product backlog and prioritizes features based on business value.

- **Backend Developer:**  
  Implements server-side logic, database interactions, and API endpoints. Ensures code quality and adherence to best practices.

- **Database Administrator (DBA):**  
  Manages database design, optimization, and maintenance. Ensures data integrity and security.

- **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:**  
  Develops and executes test plans to identify bugs and ensure software quality. Collaborates with developers to resolve issues.

- **DevOps Engineer:**  
  Implements CI/CD pipelines and manages deployment processes. Monitors system performance and ensures uptime.

## Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Used for building the backend APIs.

- **MySQL:** A relational database management system used to store and manage application data.

- **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.

- **Docker:** A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, ensuring consistency across environments.

- **GitHub Actions:** An automation tool for CI/CD workflows, enabling automated testing and deployment.

## Database Design

The database schema includes the following key entities:

- **User:**
  - Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`
  - Relationships: Can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

- **Property:**
  - Fields: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`
  - Relationships: Owned by a user; can have multiple bookings and reviews.

- **Booking:**
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`
  - Relationships: Associated with a user and a property.

- **Review:**
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  - Relationships: Written by a user for a property.

- **Payment:**
  - Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `status`
  - Relationships: Linked to a booking.

## Feature Breakdown

The application includes the following features:

- **User Management:**  
  Registration, authentication, and profile management for users.

- **Property Management:**  
  Allows property owners to list, update, and delete their properties.

- **Booking System:**  
  Enables users to book available properties for specific dates.

- **Review System:**  
  Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties they've stayed at.

- **Payment Processing:**  
  Handles secure transactions for bookings.

- **Search and Filtering:**  
  Users can search for properties based on location, price, and other criteria.

## API Security

Security measures implemented in the project include:

- **Authentication:**  
  Implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify user identities.

- **Authorization:**  
  Role-based access control to restrict actions based on user roles.

- **Input Validation:**  
  Ensures that all user inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Protects the API from abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.

- **Data Encryption:**  
  Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices are employed to streamline development:

- **Continuous Integration:**  
  Automated testing is triggered on each push to the repository to ensure code quality.

- **Continuous Deployment:**  
  Successful builds are automatically deployed to the staging environment.

- **Tools Used:**
  - **GitHub Actions:** Automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
  - **Docker:** Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
